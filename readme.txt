Go through the screenshot.Type the name of the file to be ignored inside the .gitignore file
If we wrie *.log inside the gitignore file then all files with extension .log will be ignored
3If I write dir/ inside the gitignore file,then if a directory dir exists in this folder its contents will be ignored by git
Image3 we get when we do not write dir/ in gitignore file
Image4 when we write dir/ in gitignore file.
We also write *.png so that screenshots are not considered
Finally we will get image5
